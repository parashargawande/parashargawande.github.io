# Embedded Smart Street Light System

## Overview

The **Embedded Smart Street Light System** is a smart energy-efficient lighting solution designed to automate street light operation based on ambient light and motion detection. The system uses **LDR** and **PIR sensors** to dynamically control light intensity and employs **GSM-based fault detection** to enhance maintainability.

Developed using **Arduino-based microcontrollers**, this system helps reduce energy consumption, lower COâ‚‚ emissions, and streamline maintenance processes for urban and rural street lighting infrastructure.

## Features

âœ… Automated lighting using ambient and motion sensors\
âœ… Fault detection via GSM alerts\
âœ… Power-efficient LED usage with dimming control\
âœ… Real-time clock (RTC) based time-sensitive behavior\
âœ… Wireless communication between poles (HC-12 module)\
âœ… Works on PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for intensity control

## Problem Statement

Traditional street lights waste significant electricity by operating at full intensity all night. This project addresses that problem by:

- Automating light activation based on motion and light levels
- Reducing intensity in the absence of motion
- Detecting faulty lights for timely maintenance
- Saving power through LED-based dimming

---

## Goals and Objectives

- Reduce electricity consumption by 50% or more
- Implement fault detection for maintenance alerts
- Decrease operational and maintenance costs
- Reduce COâ‚‚ emissions by replacing sodium lamps with LEDs
- Increase system lifespan with reliable embedded hardware

- **LDR Sensor**: Detects ambient light and triggers night mode
- **PIR Sensor**: Detects motion to activate full brightness
- **GSM Module**: Sends alerts if a streetlight fails
- **RTC Module**: Ensures time-bound activation and dimming
- **HC-12 Modules**: Enable master-slave communication
- **PWM**: Used to modulate LED brightness (100% / 50%)

## Algorithm Workflow

*Figure: Sequence Diagram of the System Workflow*

```text
1. LDR checks for ambient light after 6PM
2. If low light, LED turns on and notifies slave lights
3. After 11PM, default brightness = 50%
4. PIR detects motion:
   - If detected, brightness = 100% temporarily
5. Faulty lights are detected via LDR-GSM logic
6. At 6AM, all lights turn off and reset
```
